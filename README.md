# CSOP
Supplementary software - Molecular height measurement by cell surface optical profilometry (CSOP)

Use the following codes to process CSOP images and determine molecular heights.

- CSOP0_segmentation.m: segmenting a CSOP image containing several circles into a small image of individual circle. If the CSOP image contains only one circle, proceed to CSOP1_process_stack.m.
- CSOP1_process_stack.m: take the z-stack of a single circle and determine the radially-averaged fluorescent profile.
- CSOP2_quantify_height_stack.m: take the radially-averaged fluorescent profile generated by CSOP1_process_stack.m and determined the true radii of two fluorscent channels. Use this if CSOP image is two stacks of individual channel.
- CSOP2_quantify_height_channel.m: take the radially-averaged fluorescent profile generated by CSOP1_process_stack.m and determined the true radii of two fluorscent channels. Use this if CSOP image is a stack of alternating channels.

Use the following codes to simulate a CSOP image.

- CSOPsim_circle.m

example.zip includes example CSOP images. Unzip and update its location in 'PathName' in CSOP0_segmentation.m, CSOP1_process_stack.m, and CSOP2_quantify_height.m.
